SwiftLink Protocol

What is SwiftLink?
Imagine you want to send a letter to a friend. To make sure the letter gets to your friend safely, you put it in an envelope, seal it, and write their address on it.
SwiftLink is like a super smart envelope that not only ensures your letter reaches the right person but also makes sure no one can read or change the letter while it's being delivered.

Why is SwiftLink Important?
When people send messages or information over the internet, it's like sending letters through a big, crowded post office.
Sometimes, letters can get lost, be opened by someone else, or even be changed. SwiftLink was created to stop that from happening.

How Does SwiftLink Work?
Safe Delivery: Just like sealing an envelope, SwiftLink wraps your message in a special code that only the person you’re sending it to can understand.
This keeps the message safe from prying eyes.

Message Check: Before your message is sent, SwiftLink puts a unique stamp on it.
When your friend receives the message, they can check the stamp to make sure the message wasn’t tampered with or damaged on the way.

Proof of Sender: SwiftLink also includes a special mark that proves the message really came from you.
This way, your friend knows it’s genuinely from you and not from someone pretending to be you.

Why Should You Care?
SwiftLink makes communication over the internet safer and more reliable.
Whether it’s sharing important information, sending private messages, or even doing business online, SwiftLink helps ensure that what you send is exactly what the other person receives, without any changes or snooping.

Overview

    SwiftLink is a lightweight and advanced network communication protocol designed for secure, efficient, and reliable data transmission between devices.
    The protocol features custom encryption, checksum validation, and message authentication, making it ideal for applications where security and performance are critical.

Features

    Custom XOR Encryption: Ensures that the data is securely transmitted over the network.
    Checksum Validation: Guarantees the integrity of the message by verifying that the data has not been altered during transmission.
    Message Authentication Code (MAC): Provides an additional layer of security by verifying the authenticity of the message.
    Lightweight and Fast: Designed to be simple and efficient, with minimal overhead.

Installation
Clone the Repository

          git clone https://github.com/hlnaveen/swiftlink.git
          cd swiftlink  

Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

          # On Windows
          python -m venv venv
          .\venv\Scripts\activate
          
          # On macOS/Linux
          python3 -m venv venv
          source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies :              pip install -r requirements.txt
If no external dependencies are required, this step can be skipped.


Usage
Running the SwiftLink Server
To start the SwiftLink server:      python examples/example_server.py


Running the SwiftLink Client
To send a message using the SwiftLink client:        python examples/example_client.py


The client will send a message to the server and display the server's response.

Examples
Server
The server listens for incoming messages and responds with an acknowledgment message.

                  from src.swiftlink_server import swiftlink_server
            
                  if __name__ == "__main__":
                      swiftlink_server('127.0.0.1', 5000)

Client
The client sends a message to the server and processes the server's response.

                from src.swiftlink_client import swiftlink_client
                
                if __name__ == "__main__":
                    swiftlink_client('127.0.0.1', 5000, 1, 1)


Testing
Unit tests are provided to ensure that the SwiftLink protocol functions as expected.

Running Tests        python -m unittest discover tests

This command will run all tests in the tests/ directory and provide output on their status.
